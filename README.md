MIT Bad Bank Capstone

This was my final project for my bootcamp through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is a bad bank because it has no security but you can create an account, login, deposit, withdraw, transfer, and check your balance/user data that is stored using MongoDB.

To try this program out you can fork this repository and run node index.js. Then, just navigate to the local host.

In the future, I would like to add more security so you can only see your data when you login and not the other users who have created an account on the site. I would also like to add an option to sign in with Google.

Tech stack: Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Bootstrap
